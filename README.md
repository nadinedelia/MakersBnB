## Challenges With This Project

- Learning an entirely new framework in 5 days no experience in asynchronous programming.
- We encountered an issue with the order functions were run in. This was due to asynchronocity with Javascript. We overcame this through the use of labelling functions as async functions using `await` and `.then()` keywords.
- We were unable to implement CSS styling with `.jade` files and instead opted to use static html. We were then unable to display javascript variables and instead decided to changed the rendering engine to `.ejs`.

## Teamwork

- We scheduled a daily standup from 10:00 - 10:30 every morning in which we discussed our current progress in the features we were working on as well as laid out our goals for the remainder of the day.
- We scheduled a meeting after every significant milestone in order to consolidate our work and work through merging conflicts
- In the final stages of the project, we worked collectively on certain issues.
